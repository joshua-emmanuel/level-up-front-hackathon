- As a merchant, when I focus on the search box on the top bar, I can freely type into the input. At the moment, no further actions or results should occur. A merchant should only be able to type freely in the box.

- As a merchant, when I click on the notification bell, I see a dropdown panel that shows me an empty list of notifications since I have none yet. When I click on the notification bell again, this dropdown panel is closed.

- As a merchant, when I click on the name of my store Davii Collections, or on my profile image placeholder DC on the far right of the topbar menu, I see a menu with a list of menu items as specified by the Figma design. Clicking on this button again closes the menu. Finally, when I click on any of the menu items in this menu, I am redirected to [admin.shopify.com](https://admin.shopify.com)

- As a merchant, when I click on any of the 5 onboarding steps, it expands the panel, showing the content of the onboarding step, and closes the previously opened one. When I click on an opened onboarding step, nothing happens.

- As a merchant, when I click on the circle checkbox (empty) on the left side of an onboarding step title, it marks that step as completed, and expands the next incomplete step. If I click again, it marks the step as incomplete. As I mark steps as completed or incomplete, I see the onboarding progress bar showing the correct progress.
